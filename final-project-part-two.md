# Final Project Part 2: Progress Report!

[Ongoing development of charts with Shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/5mbPhLN6UfT5mhl0)

### Other chart plans
- Streaming user demographics.
- Who is buying physically? Maybe a pie chart.
- Some chart highlighting indie artists
- Graphic: revenue to artist from a stream vs revenue from buying an album. To compare the sheer magnitude

# Miscellaneous data points

- **One point:** If an artist gets $0.003 per stream, then to make $1, they need ~333 streams; to make $3, ~1,000 streams.
- **Different point:** SEA (streaming equivalent album):, 10 song sales or 1,500 song streams from an album are treated as equivalent to one purchase of the album
- **Other comment:** Deluxe CDs cost $20 while manufacturing is $1.50. Big artists are making $1-$3 while indie artists could be making as much as $15.

# Target audience

### Budget-conscious streamer
- **Background & Habits:** Age 18–29, listens to Spotify or other streaming platforms daily, rarely buys physical music, very cost-sensitive.
- **Pain Points:** Skeptical that physical music is worth the extra cost.
- **Desired Shift:** Needs reassurance that buying CDs or vinyl isn’t too expensive and provides value beyond streaming.

### Traditional music lover
- **Background & Habits:** Age 30–50, owns CDs or vinyl, enjoys album art and high-quality sound, loyal to specific genres.
- **Pain Points:** Concerned that physical media is disappearing and unsure if buying new CDs is cost-effective.
- **Desired Shift:** Wants evidence that physical media remains relevant, preserves culture, and supports artists.

### Indie artist supporter
- **Background & Habits:** Age 20–40, seeks out emerging or independent artists, buys merch, attends shows, values transparency about artist revenue.
- **Pain Points:** Low streaming payouts make it hard to support small artists effectively; unsure how purchases impact artists.
- **Desired Shift:** Needs to see that buying physical music meaningfully supports small artists and is a cost-effective alternative to streaming.


# User interviews
Users were shown the current charts in Shorthand supplemented by sketches from Part 1.

## Questions
1. Before watching the presentation, how often do you buy physical media (games, music, movies)?
2. After watching, what is your biggest takeaway about physical vs. digital ownership?
3. Did any particular data point, chart, or story surprise you? Why?
4. Do you feel more inclined to buy physical media after seeing this presentation? Why or why not?
5. Was anything confusing, boring, or missing that would make the message stronger?
6. If you were to explain this presentation to a friend in one sentence, what would you say?

## User 1 - MechE Student
1. I own a few CDs from my favorite artists that I listen to sometimes. I also like seeing them live in concert.
2. I think physically owning something is important. Making physical purchases helps support artists!
3. I was surprised by the third chart. I had no opinion before but it is surprising that the Spotify users are split perfectluy in half. Are these all of the albums on Spotify or just a few?
4. I definitely want to buy more CDs now. I didn't realize just how little an artist made from streams :(
5. I really want to see the full charts for some of the sketches. I think theyw ould help with the message.
6. People should buy CDs to support artists they love.

## User 2 - ECE Student
1. i do not buy any media. i mostly play games online
2. physical ownership is less popular than it used to be
3. surprising that digital sales were never very popular
4. i dont think i would buy any but i will think about it in the future
5. this was not very relatable for me because i do not buy any music or pay for streaming but i would want to know how much a cd costs
6. less people are buying physical music than they used to

## User 3 - Economics Alum
1. Well I occasionally buy video games for my Nintendo switch but I do not use it much anymore. I do not own any CDs or movies and I also do not have anything that could play them.
2. The music industry is smaller than it used to be. When everyone was buying CDs it was worth a lot, but now with digital and streaming no one is buying. Maybe they are pirating music instead?
3. Nothing was surprising per say but this was interesting data. I like the graph with the thick lines. I have never seen one like that before.
4. Next time I buy a game I will definitely get a physical copy.
5. Could you add something about piracy and how it is affecting these numbers? I don't really know if you could find any data on that but it would be interesting to see
6. Fewer people are buying CDs and music physically and instead streaming is becoming the most popular way to listen to music.
