[Ongoing development of charts with Shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/5mbPhLN6UfT5mhl0)

### Other chart plans
- Streaming user demographics.
- Who is buying physically? Maybe a pie chart.
- Some chart highlighting indie artists

# Miscellaneous data points

- **One point:** If an artist gets $0.003 per stream, then to make $1, they need ~333 streams; to make $3, ~1,000 streams.
- **Different point:** SEA (streaming equivalent album):, 10 song sales or 1,500 song streams from an album are treated as equivalent to one purchase of the album
- **Other comment:** Deluxe CDs cost $20 while manufacturing is $1.50. Big artists are making $1-$3 while indie artists could be making as much as $15.
