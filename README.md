# TSWD-portfolio-templates
These portfolio templates are for setting up your Telling Stories with Data site.  Edit these pages and add new ones as needed.   
It's always helpful to keep track of your web URL.  Consider putting that somewhere on your page for easy reference:

# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hello! I'm Amalia (she/her), a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon. This is my fifth and final year at CMU and I'm excited to finally leave. I am a huge cat person! Please enjoy this ASCII art:

# What I hope to learn
Here are some of the things I hope to learn in the next 6 weeks:
- I hope to relearn how to put photos on websites
- I'm looking forward to learning some tools for making data visualizations
- This online portfolio is very exciting! I wawnt to learn how to manage it and populate it with interesting work.
